<h1>Jigsaw Solver - Computer Vision Assignment 4</h1>

<p><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Vision</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> 4</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> MATLAB</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains the implementation of a Jigsaw puzzle solver using computer vision techniques. The solver is developed as part of my third assignment in the Computer Vision course. The goal of the assignment is to design an algorithm capable of solving a scrambled Jigsaw puzzle by identifying, matching, and rearranging the pieces based on their visual features.
In 3 different size 40, 160, 640 rotated</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Detection and extraction of individual puzzle pieces.</li>
  <li>Feature extraction from puzzle pieces (e.g., edges, corners, and textures).</li>
  <li>Piece matching and reassembly using computational algorithms.</li>
  <li>Visualization of the solved puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>MATLAB (for the code implementation).</li>
  <li>Image processing techniques (such as edge detection, image segmentation, and feature matching).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The solver follows a series of steps to identify and solve the Jigsaw puzzle:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load and preprocess the scrambled puzzle image.</li>
  <li>Detect the edges and extract individual puzzle pieces using segmentation algorithms.</li>
  <li>Apply feature matching techniques to identify corresponding pieces.</li>
  <li>Reassemble the pieces in the correct order to form the solved puzzle.</li>
  <li>Display the solved puzzle visually for verification.</li>
</ol>
